# GUI Examples with Tkinter

This project contains three Python scripts, each demonstrating the creation of a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Tkinter library in Python. Each script showcases a different geometry manager available in Tkinter: pack, grid, and place.

## Files

1. `pack_gui.py`: Demonstrates a simple calculator interface using the pack geometry manager.
2. `grid_gui.py`: Shows a sign-up page layout using the grid geometry manager.
3. `place_gui.py`: Displays a login page design utilizing the place geometry manager.

## Running the GUIs

Ensure you have Python installed on your system along with Tkinter, which is typically included in standard Python installations.

To run each GUI example, execute the corresponding Python script:

```bash
python pack_gui.py
python grid_gui.py
python place_gui.py
